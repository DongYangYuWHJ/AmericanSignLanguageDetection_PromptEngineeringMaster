# Sign Echo - AI Tool that Builds a Bridge from Silence to Speech

## "Your sign, echoed in voices"

SignEcho is an AI-powered wearable communication system that enables real-time conversation between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and hearing people. By translating sign language into spoken words, SignEcho bridges the communication gap â€” fluently, seamlessly, and with dignity.
Just as our slogan says, we aim to utilize AI not to simply help people talk, but to bring people closer . . .
