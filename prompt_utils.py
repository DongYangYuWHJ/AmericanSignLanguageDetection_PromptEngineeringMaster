4. Ensure recognition results match the standard sign language vocabulary"""

# Sign language examples description
SIGN_EXAMPLES = """
Here are detailed descriptions of sign language gestures:

CAT: form an open 'F' handshape with your dominant hand, where the index finger and thumb are separated. Position your hand near the side of your cheek. Pull your hand away from your face while bringing the index finger and thumb together, mimicking the action of pulling a cat's whiskers. The palm starts facing towards your face and ends facing sideways.

ME: extend your index finger (the rest of the fingers remain curled). Point to the center of your chest without any movement; simply point to yourself. The palm faces towards your body.

HELLO: use an open 'B' handshape (fingers extended and together, thumb extended). Touch the fingertips to the side of your forehead, above your eyebrow. Move your hand away from your forehead in a saluting motion. The palm faces outward. A friendly facial expression is appropriate.

DONE: use both hands in open '5' handshapes (fingers spread). Hold your hands in front of you at chest level. Twist both hands outward simultaneously so that the palms change from facing you to facing away. The palms start facing you and end facing away. An affirmative nod or a facial expression indicating completion can accompany the sign.

LEARN: position your non-dominant hand open with the palm facing up (acting as a book or source of information); the dominant hand starts with an open relaxed hand. Touch the fingertips of the dominant hand to the palm of the non-dominant hand, then bring the dominant hand up to the forehead, closing the fingers together as if grasping information and placing it into your head. The dominant hand starts with the palm facing down and ends with fingertips touching the forehead; the non-dominant hand has the palm facing up. A focused facial expression can be used to indicate the act of learning.

FINE: use an open '5' handshape (fingers extended and spread). Touch the thumb to the center of the chest. Tap the thumb against the chest once or twice. The palm faces sideways or slightly outward. A neutral or positive facial expression is appropriate.
